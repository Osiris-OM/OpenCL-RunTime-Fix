This is a fix to the issue related to many password cracking applications not able to utilize and use the OpenCL. This issue mostly have been seen in parrot VM and in rare occasions in Kali.

usage is easy:

```bash
$ git clone 
$ cd OpenCL-RunTime-Fix
$ sudo ./install.sh 
>Alternatively you can use:
$ Sudo ./install_GUI.sh

> you might need to run it two or three times, as the first one will prompt you to aggree with the EULA. and second time to agree to installation parameters.

```
